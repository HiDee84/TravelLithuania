        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" > Vilnius is the capital and largest city of Lithuania, with a population of 592,389 as of 2022.
            The population of Vilnius's functional urban area, which stretches beyond the city limits, 
            is estimated at 706,832 (as of 2019), while according to the Vilnius territorial health insurance fund, 
            there were 732,421 permanent inhabitants as of October 2020 in Vilnius city and Vilnius district municipalities

        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" > Kaunas is the second-largest city in Lithuania after Vilnius and an important centre of Lithuanian economic, academic, 
            and cultural life. Kaunas was the biggest city and the centre of a county in the Duchy of Trakai of the Grand Duchy of 
            Lithuania and Trakai Palatinate since 1413. In the Russian Empire, it was the capital of the Kaunas Governorate from 1843 to 1915.
            During the interwar period, it served as the temporary capital of Lithuania, when Vilnius was seized by Poland between 1920 and 
            1939. During that period Kaunas was celebrated for its rich cultural and academic life, fashion, construction of countless Art 
            Deco and Lithuanian National Romanticism architectural-style buildings as well as popular furniture, the interior design of the 
            time, and a widespread café culture. The city interwar architecture is regarded as among the finest examples of European Art 
            Deco and has received the European Heritage Label. It contributed to Kaunas being named as the first city in Central and Eastern 
            Europe to be designated as a UNESCO City of Design. Kaunas has been selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2022, 
            together with Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaunas" > More about Kaunas here </a></p>

        <h3> kernavė </h3> 
        <center><img src="images/Kernave.jpg" alt="Kernave" width="1032px" height="684px" ></center>
        <p  style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" > Kernavė was a medieval capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and today is a tourist attraction 
            and an archeological site (population 272, 2011). It is located in the Širvintos district municipality located in southeast 
            Lithuania. A Lithuanian state cultural reserve was established in Kernavė in 1989. In 2004 Kernavė Archaeological Site was 
            included into UNESCO world heritage list. Kernavė is a small town in the southeastern part of Lithuania, in Širvintos district, 
            located on the right bank of the river Neris, on the upper Neris terrace. It is 21 kilometers (13 mi) distance from Širvintos 
            and 35 kilometers (22 mi) from Vilnius. It is close to the Vilnius-Kaunas (18 km or 11 mi) and Vilnius-Panevėžys (17 km or 11 mi) 
            highways. It is possible to travel to Kernavė from Vilnius by the river Neris. The area of Kernavė was sparsely inhabited at the end 
            of the Paleolithic era, with the number of settlements significantly increasing in the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras.
            Fragment of a map of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1613) and Kernavė (Kiernow) "The first capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania", 
            shown just north of the capital Vilnius (Vilna). The town was first mentioned in 1279, when, as the capital of the Grand Duke Traidenis, 
            it was besieged by the Teutonic Knights. In 1390, during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392), the knights burned the town and its 
            buildings in the Pajauta valley, including the castle. After this raid, the town wasn't rebuilt, and the remaining residents moved to 
            the top of the hill instead of staying in the valley. In later years, the remains of city were covered with an alluvial earth layer, 
            that formed wet peat. It preserved most of the relics intact, and it is a treasure trove for archaeologists, leading some to call Kernavė 
            the "Troy of Lithuania". For example, Kernavė has the oldest known medgrinda, a secret underwater road paved with wood. The road was used 
            for defense and dates from the 4–7th centuries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernav%C4%97" > More about kernavė here </a></p>

        <h3> Klaipeda </h3> 
        <center><img src="images/Klaipeda.jpg" alt="Klaipeda" width="1032px" height="684px" ></center> 
        <p  style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" > Klaipėda is a city in Lithuania on the Baltic Sea coast. The capital of the eponymous county, it is the third 
            largest city and the only major seaport in Lithuania. The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional 
            importance of the usually ice-free Port of Klaipėda at the mouth of the river Akmena-Danë. It was controlled by successive German states 
            until the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. As a result of the 1923 Klaipėda Revolt it was annexed by Lithuania and has remained with Lithuania 
            to this day, except between 1939 and 1945 when it was returned to Germany following the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania. The population 
            has migrated from the city to its suburbs and hinterland. The number of inhabitants of Klaipėda city shrank from 202,929 in 1989 to 162,360 
            in 2011, but the urban zone of Klaipėda expanded well into the suburbs, which sprang up around the city and surrounded it from three sides. 
            These are well integrated with the city (city bus lines, city water supply, etc.) and the majority of inhabitants of these suburbs work in Klaipėda. 
            According to data from the Department of Statistics, there are 212,302 permanent inhabitants (as of 2020) in Klaipėda city and Klaipėda district 
            municipalities combined. Popular seaside resorts found close to Klaipėda are Neringa to the south on the Curonian Spit and Palanga to the north. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaip%C4%97da" > More about Klaipeda here </a></p>

        <h3> Alytus </h3>     
        <center><img src="images/alytus.jpg" alt="Neringa" width="1032px" height="684px" ></center> 
        <p  style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" > Alytus is a city with municipal rights in southern Lithuania. It is the capital of Alytus County. Its population 
            in 2020 was 49,895. Alytus is the historical centre of the Dzūkija region. The city lies on the banks of the Nemunas River. The major roads 
            linking Vilnius, Kaunas, Lazdijai (border with Poland), and Hrodna in Belarus pass through Alytus.Divided onto two separate entities for centuries, 
            it consists of two parts still frequently referred to as Alytus I and Alytus II, the earlier being a smaller town and the latter forming the city 
            centre with parks, microdistricts and industrial areas. The first historical record of Alytus dates back to 1377,[1] when it was mentioned in the 
            Chronicles of Wigand of Marburg under the name of Aliten. According to the chronicle the spot was occupied by a small, wooden fortress guarding the 
            Lithuanian frontier with the Teutonic Order. The fort and the surrounding village gradually grew, despite being frequently a target of raids of both 
            the Lithuanians and the Teutons. The Treaty of Lake Melno left the town on the Teutonic side of the border, but it was retaken soon afterwards. 
            On 15 June 1581 Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Stefan Batory granted the town the city rights based on the Magdeburg Law. 
            The event is celebrated as the Alytus Day. Until the Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the town was a part of the Trakai Voivodeship 
            of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and a notable center of commerce on the Nemunas River, serving as the main route for export goods from Lithuania proper. 
            The town was also important as the place where one of the royal economic offices was located. In the third partition of Poland and Lithuania, in 1795, 
            the town was divided between the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia. During the Napoleonic Wars, following the Treaty of Tilsit, the western part 
            was ceded to the Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna it became part of the duchy's successor state, the Kingdom of Poland. Although the 
            state was tied with a personal union with Russia, both parts of the town remained completely separate until the January Uprising of 1863. After that date, 
            the autonomy of Poland was liquidated, but both parts of the town remained governed separately. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alytus" > More about Alytus here </a></p>
